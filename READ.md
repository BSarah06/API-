# Cryptocurrency Data Fetching Project

## Chosen API
For this project, I chose the CoinGecko API (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api). CoinGecko provides a comprehensive and reliable source of cryptocurrency data. 

## Why I Found It Interesting
I found the CoinGecko API interesting for several reasons:

1. **Relevance and Popularity**: Cryptocurrencies have become a significant part of the financial world, and their popularity continues to grow. Accessing up-to-date information about cryptocurrencies is valuable for anyone interested in finance, investing, or blockchain technology.

2. **Comprehensive Data**: The CoinGecko API provides detailed information about a wide range of cryptocurrencies. It offers various endpoints that allow developers to access data such as current prices, historical data, market trends, and more.

4. **Free Access**: CoinGecko offers a free tier with generous rate limits, allowing developers to use the API without needing a paid subscription. This makes it an excellent choice for learning, experimentation, and small projects.

By using the CoinGecko API, I was able to create a simple yet effective webpage that fetches and displays the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API into a web application and visualize the data in a user-friendly format.
